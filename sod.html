                        In this game, you'll guide a little dragon on a quest to solve the riddle of his fractured world.
                        Along the way, you'll encounter many other tiny dragons, each with their own story arc, all working together towards the same goal.<br />

                    <p style="margin-bottom : 4em">
                        Your dragon will need to make connections with others, solve puzzles, defeat baddies, and grow stronger to succeed.
                        The game is full of challenges, but with each success, your dragon will learn and grow, unlocking new magic and abilities to tune as you progress.
                        I can't wait for you to join in on this adventure and discover the secrets of this fantastical world.<br />

                    <h3 class="major">Procedural Generation</h3>
                    <p>
                        "Procedural Generation" is the key focus of this project.
                        From the world map to loot, puzzles, and rewards, nearly everything is designed to be procedurally generated within set bounds.<br /><br />

                        By prioritizing generative content and tuneability, I'm able to create a game that is not only customizable and flexible, but also easier to develop and maintain in the long run.
                        I'm confident that the game will evolve and grow in exciting and unexpected ways as it is played and modified.

                            <h3 class="major">The never-ending map</h3>
                            <p>
                                The high-level game map is generated procedurally, allowing for a unique experience each time the game is played.
                                One of the key features of this generation process is the ability to customize the style of the paths within the map.
                                With this level of flexibility, the path generation can be adjusted to create a wide range of unique path styles, ensuring that the player never gets bored.
                                This adds an extra layer of depth to the game, making each playthrough a fresh and exciting experience.

                            <p>
                                One of my favorite things to mess around with is VFX.
                                I did a fair bit of tinkering with VFX graph and have been able to create some interesting effects.
                                I've enjoyed the creative process of experimenting with different settings and configurations.
                                I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited to continue exploring the possibilities of VFX in Unity

                                The camera in the game adjusts its angles dynamically to enhance the player's experience, whether it's to show off cinematic pieces or to create a more intimate atmosphere during dialogues.
                                The camera reacts to the situation or setting of the game, providing the player with the best view possible.
                                By adapting to the player's actions, the camera creates a more immersive and engaging experience.
