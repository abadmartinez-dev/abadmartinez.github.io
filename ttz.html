                        Tap Tap Zoo is an neat little idle game that I developed, with a focus on animal collection and simple interactions.
                        The game allows players to grow the size of their zoo and care for a variety of animals, from cute and cuddly to exotic and rare.

                        One of the key features of Tap Tap Zoo is its vibrant and colorful visual design, which draws players into the game world and enhances their experience.
                        I took on the task of creating custom art and animations for the game's diverse range of animals and environments.
                        I also made sure to prioritize the optimization of the game's visuals, ensuring that they were well-suited for a range of devices and would run smoothly even on lower-end hardware.

                        Overall, Tap Tap Zoo was a fun and rewarding project to work on, and I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with it.
                        The game provides players with a unique and entertaining way to interact with animals, while also offering a satisfying idle gameplay experience that can be enjoyed for hours on end.
